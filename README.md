# Project Summary
People refrain from offline shopping due to the spread of COVID-19, but existing online malls only support social interactions for efficient shopping and do not provide social interactions for social fun, which people enjoy during offline shopping. 

So, we present **Mall and More**, a new social interactive online shopping mall where people can feel like 'being there' and also shop together in real-time and non-real-time with their friends.

We designed and implemented 1) visualizing other users' behaviors for the presence, 2) following friends' screens for real-time shopping together, and 3) creating space-based comments for non-real-time communication.
